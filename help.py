====================================
Welcome to the directory/file snapshot tool. This tool

and compare two snapshots, listing any directories and files
added or deleted between the first snapshot and the second.
To run the program follow the following procedure:
1. Create a snapshot of a file system to monitor.
2. Install (or uninstall) a program under test.
3. Create another snapshot.
4. Compare the snapshots and note the results.'''
